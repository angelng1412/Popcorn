## Our Design
Out HelpDesk is designed with the Ticket as the fundamental unit. When a help request is submitted, the VIPLevel, problem, and name attributes are taken note of. This information is added on to a ticket. In addition to this, we utilized an ArrayPriorityQueue that contains the generated tickets. We believe this implementation of a help desk makes it easiest to visualize and edit.
